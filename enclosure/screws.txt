Using course thread brass standoffs. Drilled holes in the plastic enclosure with a 7/64in drill bit. This worked fine for everything except for the post that was already in the enclosure. I also had to bore out the holes in the Whistler board with a 9/64in drill bit so the standoffs would go through. You have to be careful with the wratchet (5mm or 3/16in) and make sure you are not rubbing it on the PCB. It will remove the soldermask.
